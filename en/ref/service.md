# 9.5 Service API

## `class` Service

Fabrix Services contain most of the application's business logic. Service methods are invoked by Controller handlers to process requests.
Service classes are singletons; that is, each subclassed Service is instantiated once, and that reference is maintained during the life of the program.

### `constructor (app)`

Initialize the Service with the provided `app` instance.

| @param | type | description | required? |

| `app` | `fabrix` | the Fabrix application instance | yes |
