# 9.4 Policy API

## `class` Policy

A Policy is a special kind of handler that decides whether to forward requests to the Controllers. Fabrix Policy classes are singletons; that is, each subclassed Policy is instantiated once, and that reference is maintained during the life of the program.

### `constructor (app)`

Initialize the Policy with the provided `app` instance.

| @param | type | description | required? |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `app` | `fabrix` | the Fabrix application instance | yes |

## Methods

## Fields
